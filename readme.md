# Clothing App
The main function of this app is to allow users to upload images and then display those images to them. 
Liking images and disliking images will also allow users to find those images later. Messaging is also incorporated into the app to allow users to communicate. 

## Installation
Make sure you install all dependancies in the pipfile and package.json file. ```npm install```
I used pipenv as the virtual environment for this project.

## Usage
To get the app running you need to use ```npm run build command``` and ```python main.py``` command in separate terminals in order get front end and back end running. 
The app runs through the main.py file. All routing done by vue router. Do not try to use the back end to route users(flask). This makes it so only one index.html file is necessary.
